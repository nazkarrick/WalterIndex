```
PROJECT 4 (SOLO): General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive 1-19
```
## Walter Index
The idea behind this project is to recreate a web based tool in the interest of Astronomy and general Science. This tool will enable user's to view information, add image to their favorite list, and login and signup. 

## Usage
We make the NASA API request when the server is loaded and the User is brought to the index page where they are presented with a datepicker Form:

```
- User has two options to input their date: 
  1. Dropdown Calendar
  2. Text input YYYY/MM/DD
- User clicks submit
- Form submit listener activates and renders a function to return the json object.
```
