PROJECT 4 (SOLO): General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive 1-19
```
## Walter Index
- The idea behind this project is to recreate a web based tool in the interest of Astronomy and general Science. This search tool will enable user's to cycle through information provided for the progress of ('extra')Terrestial exploration!

## Usage
- Make a request to NASA's OPEN API Key and display data using the magic of Python and Bootstrap!!

## Goals
- Explore the usage of API and data visualization tools
- Refine my understanding of Python and its available supporting libraries and frameworks
- Build using a front end not previously taught

```
- User has two options to input their date: 
  1. Dropdown Calendar
  2. Text input YYYY/MM/DD
- User clicks submit
- Form submit listener activates and renders a function to return the json object.
- Flask receives and validates then returns the object using jinja to convert the object to a viewable html document. 
- User is greeted with a converted JSON object
```
