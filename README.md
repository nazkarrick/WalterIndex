PROJECT 4 (SOLO): General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive 1-19
```
## Walter Index
- The idea behind this project is to recreate a web based tool in the interest of Astronomy and general Science. This search tool will enable user's to cycle through information provided for the progress of ('extra')Terrestial exploration!

## URL
[WalterIndex](http://nazkarrikk.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Usage
- Make a request to NASA's OPEN API Key and display data using the magic of Python and Bootstrap!!

## Goals
- Explore the usage of API and data visualization tools
- Refine my understanding of Python and its available supporting libraries and frameworks
- Build using a front end not previously taught

## Layout
```
- Present User with a simple layout where the user naturally can learn to manipulate website.
- Search Date is provided with two options:
  1. Dropdown Calender
  2. Manually input date
- Upon submit, a request to the API is sent and response is rendered in a JSON object, then rendered to HTML
- User has an option to register for mailing list with the MAILING link inside the navigation bar. 
```
